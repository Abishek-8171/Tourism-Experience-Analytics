# Tourism-Experience-Analytics
This project analyzes tourism data to classify user behavior, predict user satisfaction, and recommend tourist attractions. It examines key factors such as visit month, region, city, country, and attraction type. Machine learning models (classification, regression, and recommendation) are used to provide accurate predictions and personalized travel suggestions. For the recommendation system, both collaborative filtering and content-based models are applied to deliver better travel experiences.
